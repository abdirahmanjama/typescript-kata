<h1>Same Tree</h1>
<div>
<p>Given the roots of two binary trees, p and q, write a function that determines whether or not they're the same tree.

Two trees are considered identical if they are structurally identical and contain the same nodes. 

Note: A tree is a set of nodes, where each node has a value, and may have pointers to child nodes which form subtrees. 

The first tree is considered the <strong>root</strong> of the tree.

Nodes at the bottom are referred to as the leaf. 

Depth of the tree is the distance from a trees root to the child e.g. how many levels does it need to go through?

Tree types:

Binary trees - a tree whos nodes can have up to two child nodes.
